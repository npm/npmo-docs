# Server Configuration

You can customize the server's configuration by visiting npm
Enterprise's admin console on `:8800`

  ![Admin Console](/gitbook/images/02-settings.png)

## Your First Time Running npm Enterprise

The first time you visit your appliance on port `:8800`, there is some
initial configuration that you will need to perform:

1. because no certificate has been configured for your appliance, you
  will need to proceed past a certificate warning in the browser:

  ![Admin Console](/gitbook/images/01-security-warning.png)

2. next you will be prompted to upload a certificate, or to generate
  a self-signed certificate (this certificate will be used going forward
  when accessing the admin console, this will need to be configured
  separately for the website and registry see [Terminating SSL with NGINX]).
3. on the next screen you will be prompted for the `billing email` and
  `license key `, which you were provided with when you started your
  [npm Enterprise trial](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise).
4. you will next be prompted to set a password for the npm Enterprise
  admin console. This password is used by administrators to configure
  your appliance.
5. Next, a series of preflight checks will be run. These checks ensure that
   you are running hardware that meets the requirements.
6. The Docker containers will now begin downloading for npm Enterprise, and
   you can proceed to [customizing your configuration](#customizing-your-configuration).

## Customizing Your Configuration

There are various dials and knobs that you can use to configure your
npm Enterprise appliance:

### Full URL of npm Enterprise registry

This field should contain the URL that your users will be using
to access npm Enterprise. If you have placed a pretty DNS name on
your npm Enterprise appliance (perhaps using nginx, or a load-balancer)
you should place this DNS name here. _Note: For installs and publications
to work, this URL must be accessible._

While you may choose to use the default registry URL
(`http://my-server:8080`), setting an alternative port # will not result
in the registry binding to an alternative port (it
  always binds to `:8080`).

### Full URL of npm Enterprise website

The externally accessible URL of your npm Enterprise website.

### Your company name

The company name that should be displayed on the npm Enterprise website.

### Proxy URL

If your company connects to the external Internet through a proxy,
set the URL here.

### Secret used between services

The secret key used both between internal services and to connect
upstream replication.

### Storage

Configure the storage for npm Enterprise's various data-files. Frequently you
will need to switch these paths to match a larger external drive that
you've mounted on your appliance.

### Scoped CLI Search

By default `npm search` does not return scoped packages (since this is
  potentially a breach of private information). Enable this setting to
start returning scoped search results to the CLI.

_Note: you should only do this if your npm Enterprise appliance is
  running behind a firewall._

### Read Through Cache

By default, rather than mirroring the entire `>1TB` npm registry,
npm Enterprise selectively caches packages the first time that you
install them:

```
npm i lodash --registry=http://my-private-registry:8080
```

If you would rather selectively whitelist packages from the public registry,
or would prefer to mirror the entire registry, set this option to `No`.

### Reject Unauthorized

Set this option to `No`, if you would like to disable strict SSL checks
for operations performed by npm Enterprise.

_As an example, you might disable SSL checks if your upstream GitHub Enterprise
server is using a self-signed certificate._

### Upstream Registry

What upstream registry should npm Enterprise replicate packages from? This setting
defaults to the public registry (`https://replicate.npmjs.com`), but can be
configured to replicate from other internal npm Enterprise registries for HA
deployments.

* **Upstream URL**: the registry to replicate from.
* **Upstream secret**: if connecting to another npm Enterprise registry, provide
  the _Secret used between services_ of the upstream server.
* **Policy to apply during replication**: defaults to `white-list`, only replicating
  modules added to your whitelist file (either by an administrator, or by the
  read-through-cache). To replicate an entire upstream registry, set this value
  to `mirror`.

### Auth Scoped Installs

Should a user be required to authenticate against the registry (e.g. `npm login --registry=http://my-private-registry:8080`) in order to `npm install` scoped packages (e.g. `@company/foo`)?

This setting defaults to `Yes` to prevent anonymous users from installing private packages from your npm Enterprise registry. If your registry is running behind a firewall, you could set this to `No` to more easily share packages internally.

### Auth All Installs

Should a user be required to authenticate against the registry (e.g. `npm login --registry=http://my-private-registry:8080`) in order to `npm install` both scoped packages (e.g. `@company/foo`) and global packages (e.g. `lodash`)?

This setting defaults to `No` so that global packages cached within your npm Enterprise registry may be installed without authentication, just like the public registry. If your registry is not running behind a firewall, you may want to set this to `Yes`.

### Auth Website

Should authentication be required to view the npm Enterprise website.

### Publication Settings

The default `All` setting, allows both scoped and global modules to be
published to your npm Enterprise registry.

By setting this value to `Scoped`, only scoped modules will be allowed to
be published to your registry.

For replicas in HA deployments, you can set this value to `Read Only` to
disable all publications.

### Authentication

Rather than handling user accounts itself, npm Enterprise allows
you to connect to your company's existing authentication system.
