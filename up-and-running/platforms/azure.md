# Using Microsoft Azure

## Summary

To get npm Enterprise up and running on Microsoft Azure, you first need:

- An npm Enterprise license. Get a [free trial] here!
- A [Microsoft account] and an [Azure account]

...then we'll need to:

1. Set up and deploy an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS VM
2. Run the npmO deploy script
3. Set up endpoints for the admin panel, registry, and website

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Get a VM Up and Running

The first step is to get a VM running. Follow [this tutorial] for getting
an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS VM running.

While setting this up, make sure to:

- Pick a size that has *at least* 7 GB of RAM. **We strongly recommend 14 GB.**
- Take note of the name of the Security Group you assign. We'll need to edit it
  in Step 3.

Feel free to make any other configurations you wish. Once you are set, deploy
your VM and move on to Step 2!

## Step 2: Install npm Enterprise

Now that you have a VM deployed, let's install the npm Enterprise (`npmo`) tool.

1. SSH into your VM
2. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashleygwilliams/npmo-deploy/master/deploy.sh | sh`
3. Let it run! It can take a minute or two, depending on the specs of your VM.

  This script:

  - updates `apt-get`
  - installs `curl` via `apt-get`
  - installs Node.js, via [NodeSource]
  - updates npm
  - displays Node.js and npm versions
  - installs `npmo` globally as the root user, via npm


4. To confirm that it worked, type `npmo`. If the install succeeded you should see the
   `npmo help` screen, which looks like this:

## Step 3: Set up Endpoints

There are now 4 web services running on 4 ports on your VM. In order to access these
outside of the VM, we'll need to create rules to allow them to be accessed. The ports
we need to configure are:

| Service                   | Port  |
|-------------------------- |------ |
| Administrator Panel       | 8800  |
| Registry                  | 8080  |
| Website                   | 8081  |
| Authentication Endpoints  | 8082  |
