# Up and Running

In order to get up and running, you'll need to accomplish 5 things:

- Provision a server running Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, or Debian.
- Install [Node.js], ideally using a [NodeSource] dist.
- Install [npm].
- Install [npm Enterprise].
- Ensure ports `8800`, `8080`, `8081` accessible on your server.

If you feel comfortable with those steps, feel free to jump in on your own.
Otherwise, we have platform specific tutorials to help get you going:

## Platform Specific Tutorials
