# Up and Running

In order to get up and running, you'll need to accomplish 3 things:

- provision a server running Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian.
- install [Node.js], ideally using a [NodeSource] dist
- install [npm]
- install [npm OnSite]
- forward ports `8800`, `8080`, and `8081`

If you feel comfortable with those steps, feel free to jump in on your own.
Otherwise, we have platform specific tutorials to help get you going.

## Platform Specific Tutorials

If you are just looking to play around with a trial version of npm
On-Site, we recommend following the [Vagrant tutorial].

npm On-Site works on the following platforms:

  - [Microsoft Azure]
  - [Vagrant and Virtual Box]
  - [VMWare]
