# Up and Running

In order to get up and running, you'll need to accomplish 5 things:

- provision a server running Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, or Debian.
- install [Node.js], ideally using a [NodeSource] dist.
- install [npm]
- install [npm Enterprise]
- ensure ports `8800`, `8080`, `8081` accessible on your server.

If you feel comfortable with those steps, feel free to jump in on your own.
Otherwise, we have platform specific tutorials to help get you going.

## Platform Specific Tutorials

If you are just looking to play around with a trial version of npm
Enterprise, we recommend following the [Vagrant tutorial].

We currently provide platform specific tutorials for:

  - [AWS]
  - [Microsoft Azure]
  - [Vagrant]
  - [Other Linux Platforms]
